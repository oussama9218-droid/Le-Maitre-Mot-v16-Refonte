<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested to implement visual rendering (SVG) for all geometric figures generated by the backend. Throughout the session, the user also identified and requested fixes for several critical bugs:
1.  **SVG Rendering Quality:** The initial SVGs for Circles and Rectangles were illegible (too small, overlapping text).
2.  **Missing SVGs:** An audit revealed that some geometric generators (, ) were not producing the necessary data to render an SVG.
3.  **Missing :** Exercises were sometimes appearing in the frontend with no text statement ().
4.  **Thales Figure Incoherence:** The  and  for Thales' theorem exercises used different, hardcoded point names that did not match the generated SVG figure, making the exercises incorrect and unusable.
5.  **Application Unavailability:** A recurring environment issue caused the backend to fail on startup, preventing the user from testing the application.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- All geometric exercises (Pythagoras, Trigonometry, Thales, Circles, Rectangles, etc.) must be rendered as clean, legible SVG figures.
- The  (statement) and  text must be 100% consistent with the data and points shown in the SVG figure.
- The application must be stable and consistently available for testing after a restart.
- The system must have robust fallbacks to prevent inconsistent or empty data from reaching the user.
- Automated tests must be in place to validate data coherence and SVG generation.

**User's preferred language**: French

**what currently exists?**
The application now successfully generates and renders SVG figures for all relevant geometric exercises. The backend logic for rendering has been significantly improved for readability, especially for circles and rectangles. A series of critical bugs related to data consistency have been fixed. Specifically, the Thales generator is now fully coherent, with both the  and  dynamically using the correct points from the figure. The fallback mechanisms have been hardened to ensure an  is always generated. Several new automated test suites have been created to prevent regressions for SVG generation and data coherence. However, the application environment is unstable and requires manual intervention to start the backend after every container restart.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Fixing a critical bug where the solution steps for Thales' theorem exercises used hardcoded points (e.g., ) that were inconsistent with the dynamically generated figure and . The agent corrected the logic in the generator () to create dynamic solution steps and enhanced the validation in  to reject incoherent AI-generated solutions.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: The user needs to perform manual testing to verify the fix. A frontend testing agent run can also be used to confirm the end-to-end flow for Thales exercises.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Recurring Backend Startup Failure (P0 - BLOCKER)**
-   **Issue 2: User Verification for Thales Solution Fix (P1)**

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
    - **Description**: The backend service fails to start after every container restart, making the application inaccessible. This blocks all user testing and development. The logs consistently show a failure to load the  library, a dependency of

 zx : Depends: nodejs:any (>= 14) and other related libraries. This fixes the problem temporarily for the current session but does not persist after a restart.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        - A permanent solution is required. The next agent must investigate how to make system package installations persistent in the environment. This might involve modifying a Dockerfile, a startup script, or another part of the environment configuration.
        - Check for a , , or startup scripts (e.g., in  config) where these dependencies can be permanently added.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical blocker. Fixing it will make the application stable and allow the user to test without requiring agent intervention on every restart.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED (Permanent fix has not been attempted).
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both. A successful backend start must be verified, and the frontend must be checked to ensure it can fetch data.
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None. This issue is blocking everything else.

- **Issue 2:**
    - **Description**: The agent has implemented a fix for inconsistent points in the Thales exercise *solutions*. This needs to be validated by the user.
    - **Attempted fixes**: N/A
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        - Guide the user to generate several Théorème de Thalès exercises (Mathématiques > 3e).
        - Ask the user to verify that the solution steps are now fully consistent with the points in the  and the SVG figure.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This was the last identified critical bug. Its resolution will make the Thales generator fully correct and usable.
    - **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (visual verification by user).
    - **Blocked on other issue**: Issue 1: Recurring Backend Startup Failure. The user cannot test until the backend is stable.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0: Implement a Permanent Fix for Environment Dependencies**: As described in Issue 1, make the apt 2.6.1 (arm64)
Usage: apt-get [options] command
       apt-get [options] install|remove pkg1 [pkg2 ...]
       apt-get [options] source pkg1 [pkg2 ...]

apt-get is a command line interface for retrieval of packages
and information about them from authenticated sources and
for installation, upgrade and removal of packages together
with their dependencies.

Most used commands:
  update - Retrieve new lists of packages
  upgrade - Perform an upgrade
  install - Install new packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)
  reinstall - Reinstall packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)
  remove - Remove packages
  purge - Remove packages and config files
  autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
  dist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)
  dselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections
  build-dep - Configure build-dependencies for source packages
  satisfy - Satisfy dependency strings
  clean - Erase downloaded archive files
  autoclean - Erase old downloaded archive files
  check - Verify that there are no broken dependencies
  source - Download source archives
  download - Download the binary package into the current directory
  changelog - Download and display the changelog for the given package

See apt-get(8) for more information about the available commands.
Configuration options and syntax is detailed in apt.conf(5).
Information about how to configure sources can be found in sources.list(5).
Package and version choices can be expressed via apt_preferences(5).
Security details are available in apt-secure(8).
                                        This APT has Super Cow Powers. installations for

----- dependencies persistent.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - Expand the curriculum with more math topics/generators.
    - General frontend UI/UX enhancements.

**Completed work in this session**
- **SVG Rendering Implementation**:
    - Implemented SVG generation for all geometric figures (, ).
    - Added the  field to the  model () and API response.
    - Updated the frontend () to display the SVG figure.
- **SVG Rendering Quality & Bug Fixes**:
    - **Readability**: Refactored  and  in  to produce larger, clearer figures with non-overlapping labels.
    - **Thales Figure Fix**: Corrected  to draw all 5 points and the parallel line.
    - **Completeness Audit**: Audited all 16 generators and fixed  and  in  to ensure they always generate geometric data.
- **Data Coherence and Robustness Fixes**:
    - **Missing  Bug**: Identified the root cause in  () and added a visible error message.
    - **Robust Fallbacks**: Hardened all fallback functions in  with  blocks to guarantee an  is always generated.
    - **Thales  Coherence**: Implemented strict validation in  to reject AI-generated statements with incorrect points and trigger a robust, dynamic fallback.
    - **Thales  Coherence**: Corrected the hardcoded solution steps in  () to be dynamic and consistent with the figure.
- **Testing**:
    - Created  to verify SVG creation for all relevant generators.
    - Created  to ensure all generators produce a non-empty .
    - Created  to validate point consistency in the Thales .
    - Created  to validate point consistency in the Thales .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
The core environmental instability causing the backend to fail on restart has been identified and temporarily bypassed multiple times, but a permanent solution has not been implemented.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Previous Fork Issue (AI unreliability):** Resolved.
- **Current Fork Recurring Issue:** Backend service fails on startup due to non-persistent system library installations for

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Python for deterministic logic, AI for text generation.
- **Dynamic SVG Rendering**: Generating SVG strings on the fly from structured geometric data.
- **Robust Fallbacks**: A multi-layered fallback system ensuring that if an AI or specific template fails, a generic but valid response is still generated.
- **Data Coherence Validation**: Programmatically validating AI output against a source of truth (the math spec) before accepting it.
- **Environment Dependency Management**: The critical (and currently failing) need to manage system-level libraries () within the containerized environment.

**key DB schema**

 zx : Depends: nodejs:any (>= 14) to a permanent part of the environment setup (e.g., a Dockerfile or startup script). Do not proceed with any other task until the user can restart their environment and have the application work without your intervention. After that, your next task is to guide the user to verify the latest fix for Thales exercise solutions.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User (Msg 497):** Reports critical bug: Thales  has inconsistent points vs the SVG. (FIXED)
2.  **User (Msg 522):** Same problem as usual... a subject cannot be selected. - Reports the recurring backend startup failure. (TEMPORARILY FIXED)
3.  **User (Msg 529):** Reports critical bug: Thales  has inconsistent/hardcoded points. (FIXED, PENDING VERIFICATION)
4.  There are no other pending user messages. The user is waiting for a stable environment to test the latest fix.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The application environment is fundamentally broken. The backend service is not stable across restarts, making the entire application unusable without manual agent intervention.
- **Mocked**: None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Uses Emergent LLM Key for exercise text generation, with validation and fallback mechanisms.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (frontend testing agent was used).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: YES (used multiple times for the backend startup issue).
- **Test files created**:
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
- **Known regressions**: None in the code, but the environment has a major recurring regression.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent failed to implement a *permanent* solution for the recurring backend startup failure. It repeatedly applied a temporary fix (Reading package lists...
Building dependency tree...
Reading state information...
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.) without addressing the root cause of why the system libraries were not persisting across container restarts. This is a major oversight that has wasted significant time and blocked the user repeatedly.</analysis>
