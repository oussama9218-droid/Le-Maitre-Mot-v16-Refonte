<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested a series of significant enhancements to the math exercise generation platform, building upon a previously implemented set of 6th-grade generators.

The main goals were:
1.  **Address QA Feedback:** Fix critical bugs reported after a validation pass by Perplexity, including an incomplete generator for calculating volumes () and several chapters relying on generic fallback exercises.
2.  **Implement Dedicated Generators:** Create four new, specialized generators (, , , ) to replace generic ones. The ultimate goal was to ensure all 15 6th-grade chapters had fully dedicated generators.
3.  **Introduce an Official Curriculum Referencing System:**
    *   Create a canonical  file to define the official 6th-grade curriculum structure.
    *   Build a  file to map these official curriculum codes to the existing backend generator logic ().
    *   Develop a Python loader to make this curriculum data available at runtime.
    *   Extend the  endpoint to accept a new  parameter for targeted exercise generation, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing -based generation.
4.  **Build a V1 Admin Dashboard:**
    *   Create a new read-only page at .
    *   This page should fetch data from a new backend endpoint () and display a comprehensive, searchable table of the entire 6th-grade curriculum, showing the mapping between official codes, chapter names, and the underlying exercise generators.
    *   Secure this new admin functionality behind an  environment flag.

**what currently exists?**
The application now features a complete and robust 6th-grade math curriculum system.
- **Backend**:
    - All 15 6th-grade chapters now map to dedicated, non-fallback exercise generators. The critical bug with the  generator has been fixed, and four new dedicated generators have been implemented.
    - A new curriculum module () has been created. It loads the official curriculum from  at startup.
    - The  endpoint is now backward-compatible, supporting generation via the new  or the legacy  name.
    - A new admin endpoint, , exposes the complete 6th-grade curriculum mapping. It is protected by the  environment variable.
    - Comprehensive tests for the new curriculum system and admin endpoint have been created and are passing.
- **Frontend**:
    - A new read-only admin page is available at .
    - It displays a filterable and searchable table of the 27 official 6th-grade curriculum entries, showing their code, domain, description, associated generators, and status.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent just completed the implementation of the V1 read-only admin dashboard for the 6th-grade curriculum. This involved creating the backend endpoint, the frontend React page with ShadCN components, securing the feature with an environment flag, and adding documentation.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: The agent has already tested the API endpoint with  and validated the frontend with the  tool. The next step is user verification.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or in-progress issues. The last set of issues from the user's QA report (message 103) has been fully resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. The V1 Admin Page task is complete and awaiting user review.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0**: User validation of the new  page.
    - **P1**: **V2 of Admin Page**: Implement editing capabilities for the curriculum on the  page, as mentioned by the user as the next step after the read-only V1.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **P2**: Implement V1 PDF export functionality for the  page.
    - **P3**: Begin implementation of the curriculum for other grade levels (5e, 4e, etc.), leveraging the new curriculum system.
    - **P3**: Refactor , which is very large, potentially breaking it down by grade level or domain.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Addressed Perplexity QA Feedback**:
  - Fixed the critical  bug in the  generator to ensure dimensions are always provided.
  - Implemented 4 new dedicated generators for Calcul mental, Calculs posés, Calculs instrumentés, and Grandeurs et mesures.
  - Upgraded all 15 6th-grade chapters to use dedicated generators, ensuring  for all generated exercises.
- **Implemented V1 Curriculum Referencing System**:
  - Created  and .
  - Built the  to load and index the data.
  - Extended the  API to be backward-compatible with a new  parameter.
  - Added a full test suite () for the new system.
- **Implemented V1 Read-Only Admin Page**:
  - Created the  endpoint.
  - Built the  frontend page using React and ShadCN components, including search and filtering.
  - Secured the feature with an  environment flag.
  - Created documentation for both the curriculum system and the new admin page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All issues raised in this session were addressed.

**Code Architecture**
code_officielcode_officielenonce

**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Decoupled Curriculum Mapping**: The official curriculum (CSV/JSON) is now separate from the backend generator implementation, allowing for easier updates.
- **Backward-Compatible API Extension**: The generation API was extended with a new parameter () without breaking existing clients.
- **Read-Only Admin Dashboard**: A React/ShadCN frontend page was created to provide a non-technical UI for auditing the curriculum data.
- **Environment-Flagged Features**: The entire admin functionality is conditionally enabled via the  environment variable.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- You have just successfully completed a large, multi-phase project, culminating in the creation of the V1 Admin Page. Your immediate priority is to present this achievement to the user and ask for their verification.
- The next logical step, as outlined by the user, is to begin work on V2 of the admin page, which will introduce editing capabilities. Do not start this until you get confirmation from the user on V1.
- The codebase is currently in a very stable and well-tested state. All 6th-grade generators are considered dedicated, and a new, flexible curriculum system is in place.
