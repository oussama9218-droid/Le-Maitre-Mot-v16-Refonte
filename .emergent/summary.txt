<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initiated a complete architectural refactoring of the mathematics exercise generation system. The previous AI-only approach was unreliable, producing calculation errors and inconsistent geometric figures.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
The new architecture must separate mathematical logic from text generation.

1.  **Backend Logic (Python, No AI):** A new service () programmatically generates a structured . This spec contains all mathematical parameters, performs all calculations, and determines the correct solution without AI involvement. This is the single source of truth for all data, including geometry.
2.  **AI for Text Generation Only:** A new service () sends the  to an AI, instructing it only to write a natural language  (problem statement) and solution explanation. The AI is forbidden from altering numbers, points, or results.
3.  **Recombination & Fallback:** The main endpoint combines the Python-generated spec (data) and the AI-generated text (). A robust fallback mechanism generates a simple, templated  if the AI fails, ensuring 100% feature availability.
4.  **Phased Rollout:** The user requested a progressive implementation, starting with Arithmetic, simple Algebra, and basic Geometry (Pythagoras), and then extending to more advanced topics. Each phase required explicit user validation before proceeding.
5.  **Refactoring and Testing:** After implementing the features, the user requested a full code refactoring (Phase 4) for better organization and a massive testing phase (Phase 5) to ensure production readiness.
6.  **Geometry Rendering:** The user's final request was an analysis of how geometric figures are currently generated and what would be required to render them as actual images (e.g., SVG) on the frontend.

**User's preferred language**: French

**what currently exists?**
The application has undergone a massive and successful refactoring of its mathematics exercise generation engine. The backend is now a stable, robust, hybrid system where pure Python handles all mathematical and geometric logic, and an AI is used exclusively for text generation.

The backend code has been reorganized into a clean structure with dedicated directories for , , , and . This new architecture has been implemented and validated across five distinct phases, covering a wide range of mathematics topics from basic arithmetic to advanced geometry (Thales, Trigonometry). An extensive suite of over 800 automated tests was executed to confirm the stability and correctness of all 16 math exercise generators. The system is considered feature-complete and production-ready for the defined scope.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent completed a detailed analysis of the backend's geometry generation pipeline in response to a user query. The analysis explained which parts of the code generate the  and  fields, clarified that the backend currently only produces a JSON description (not a visual image), and outlined what would be needed to add image rendering capabilities.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: N/A
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known pending issues or bugs. The application is stable and has been thoroughly tested.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. All planned phases (1 through 5) have been completed and validated by the user.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0: Implement Visual Geometry Rendering**: Based on the agent's last analysis, the user's next logical request will be to implement the rendering of geometric figures.
        - **Goal**: Convert the  JSON object into an actual SVG image that can be displayed on the frontend.
        - **File to Modify/Create**: A new rendering service, potentially reusing or extending logic from , will be needed. The  and the frontend will need to be updated to handle the new image data.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **Expand Math Topics**: Add more generators for advanced mathematics chapters not yet covered.
    - **Frontend UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the display and interaction with the generated exercises on the frontend.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Phase 1: Foundational Architecture (DONE)**
    - Implemented the new hybrid architecture for Arithmetic, Algebra, and Pythagoras theorem exercises.
    - Fixed bugs in relative number calculations and chapter-to-type mapping.
- **Bug Fix: Irrational Numbers in Geometry (DONE)**
    - Corrected the Pythagoras generator to use Pythagorean triples, ensuring all lengths in problem statements are clean integers.
- **Phase 2: Feature Extension (DONE)**
    - Implemented and successfully tested generators for Volumes, Statistics, Probabilities, and Powers.
- **Phase 3: Advanced Geometry Implementation (DONE)**
    - Implemented, tested, and validated generators for Circles, Trigonometry, and Thales' theorem.
    - Added the  field to the  Pydantic model to ensure all mathematical data is returned to the frontend.
- **Phase 4: Refactoring & Securing (DONE)**
    - **Code Reorganization**: Restructured the backend into , , , and  directories.
    - **Text Securitization**: Created a  service to ensure consistency in AI-generated text (e.g., symbols, point names).
    - **Unit Testing**: Implemented a ============================= test session starts ==============================

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

============== 9 failed, 22 passed, 5 warnings, 1 error in 8.64s =============== suite with 9 unit tests for key math generators in .
- **Phase 5: Massive Testing & Validation (DONE)**
    - **Massive Generator Test**: Created and ran a script () to test all 16 math generators with 50 iterations each (800 total tests), achieving 100% success after fixing a bug in the Rectangle generator.
    - **Coherence & Integration Tests**: Validated text normalization and realistic end-to-end scenarios, including PDF export.
- **Analysis of Geometry Generation (DONE)**
    - Provided a detailed report to the user explaining the current JSON-based geometry schema generation process.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All issues identified during the development and testing phases have been resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- The primary issue from the previous fork (unreliable AI for math logic) has been completely and definitively solved by the new architecture.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Core principle is the separation of concerns. Deterministic logic is handled by Python, while creative/linguistic tasks are delegated to an AI.
- **Python-First Math Generation**: All mathematical problems, including geometric figures, are defined programmatically in Python () to ensure 100% correctness and consistency.
- **AI as a Text Service**: The AI's role is strictly limited to generating natural language ( and solution steps) based on a pre-calculated, Python-generated .
- **Structured Refactoring**: The backend code was systematically reorganized into a scalable structure with clear separation between routes (), business logic (), and data models ().
- **Massive Automated Testing**: A robust testing framework was established using ============================= test session starts ==============================

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

**All files of reference**
- **Created Directories**:
    - , , , , 
- **Key New/Refactored Files**:
    - : Major refactoring to delegate math routes to a dedicated router. The  model was updated.
    - : The core of the new architecture. Contains all 16 programmatic math exercise generators.
    - : Manages interaction with the AI for text generation and includes the robust fallback logic.
    - : Contains the primary  endpoint for math exercises.
    - : Defines the Pydantic models for the new math architecture (e.g., ).
    - : The script used for the successful stress test of all 16 generators.
    - : The unit test suite for individual generator functions.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The entire math generation refactoring project (Phases 1-5) is complete, tested, and validated by the user. The application is stable and considered production-ready. Do not modify the existing logic unless a bug is found. Your next task is to build on the agent's final analysis of geometry generation. The user's clear next step is to see the geometric figures rendered visually. You should propose a plan to implement a service that converts the  JSON object into an SVG image to be displayed on the frontend.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
- **User Message 1:** Validated the Circles module and instructed the agent to proceed with validating Trigonometry.
- **User Message 2:** Provided a structured prompt for the agent to validate the Trigonometry module and then proceed to Thales.
- **User Message 3:** Confirmed validation of Trigonometry and instructed the agent to perform a complete validation of the Thales module.
- **User Message 4:** Chose to finalize the validation of the Thales module before moving on, providing a detailed checklist for the validation.
- **User Message 5:** Validated the Thales module and all of Phase 3. Provided a detailed plan for Phase 4 (Refactoring & Securing).
- **User Message 6:** Validated Phase 4. Provided a detailed plan for Phase 5 (Complete Backend + Frontend Logic Tests).
- **User Message 7 (Pending):** Asked for a detailed analysis of the geometry generation pipeline: what generates the figures, what generates the schemas (, ), if images are created, and what is needed to display them.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: None.
- **Mocked**: None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Uses Emergent LLM Key for exercise text generation.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES. While the agent didn't use the testing agent tool, it created a comprehensive suite of automated tests using ============================= test session starts ==============================

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.

           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.
    
        .. note::
    
           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method
           such as :meth:`request`.
    
        .. note::
    
           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.
    
        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    
        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.
    
        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.
    
        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.
    
        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.
    
            If ``None`` (default) will retry 3 times, see ``Retry.DEFAULT``. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.
    
            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.
    
        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.
    
        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.
    
        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.
    
        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.
    
        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
    
        :param bool preload_content:
            If True, the response's body will be preloaded into memory.
    
        :param bool decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.
    
        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of ``preload_content``
            which defaults to ``True``.
    
        :param bool chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.
    
        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.
